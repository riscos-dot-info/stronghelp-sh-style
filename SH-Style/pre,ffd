!Pre file
#Parent !Root
The !Pre file is a piece of utility code loaded and executed by StrongHelp to enable keyword lookups to be performed more usefully. The 'standard' use of of this is to cut off an 'X' from the beginning of SWI names but almost any function could be performed. However, don't include the !Pre file from the SWIs manual automatically, unless you are documenting SWI's.

Failings in the utility code may cause StrongHelp to crash, so be careful not to cause exceptions and always call the X versions of any SWIs. The length of the utility code {/}must{/} be word aligned. If not the code will not be used.

Whilst it is possible to modify the search string to point elsewhere, it is unlikely that you will need this unless some special function is required. A good example of this is to lookup a command that is documented under a separate, non-recognisable, name. An example of this is the IRClient manual, which provides translations for function names and commands with a prefix by their module names. This process is not always fast, but can make internal organisation easier at the expense of having to re-generate the !Pre code after changes have been made.
