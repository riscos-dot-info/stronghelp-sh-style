!Root page
#Parent !Root
Every manual should have a !Root page. Without this the manual cannot be opened from the StrongHelp menu page, nor by 'running' it. The root of the manual should contain a list of sub-sections from which the entire manual should be accessible - there should not really be any 'hidden' pages only accessible via the keyword lookup or search options (unless intended as such).

The !Root page should have a {fCode}#Parent StrongHelp:!Menu{f} entry, unless it is a part of a 'group' of manuals in which case it may set the parent to the 'top' of the manual set. This use is, however, discouraged. Without this line, the manual cannot be reverse traversed back to the top most level.

It may have a title, or it may rely on the title in the titlebar to be sufficient. Beware of using an overly large font for the title; this can look untidy. It may be felt appropriate to increase the size of the 'sub-sections' of the manual for clarity.

The authors name, creation date and manual (or program to which it relates) version should be shown, or available from the !Root page. This ensures that the there is some idea of it's relevance and contact. An Email address may be included, either by {fCode}#URL{f} link from the name or via a separate page, though see the <Link guidelines=>links> on how to do this. If a separate page is included then other contact information may also be included. The practice of linking to a separate manual for addresses is to be discontinued.

The page itself should not really have cause to gain scrollbars unless it is exceptionally large. Consider sub-dividing the sub-sections, or re-organising the layout. The !Root page is the first thing the users sees and if it is cluttered it is likely that they will not find what they want quickly.
