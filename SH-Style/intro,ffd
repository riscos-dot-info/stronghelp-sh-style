Introduction (Style Guide)
#Parent !Root
This guide has come about for a number of reasons. The first of these is the proliferation of StrongHelp manuals currently available and the second (more importantly) is that some of these manuals have been quite poorly written.

As with the Acorn Style Guide, you should feel free to disregard any section of this manual as 'mindless twaddle'. However the purpose is to 'standardise' the way in which manuals are produced into making them more friendly to the user and the author.

Having written and edited a number of manuals, I do know the problems involved with writing a manual. Hopefully then, you'll take some time to read what I (and hopefully Guttorm) feel is a 'right' way to go about things.

Note: I will not cite any manuals in particular and I am not intending to attribute any kind of 'blame'. The purpose of this manual is merely to inform.
